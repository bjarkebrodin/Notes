# Requirements Engineering

The process of eliciting and analyzing requirements. The requirements engineergin process results in a requirements specification and an analysys model. Specifically a _RAD_ (requirements analysis document).

We differentiate requirements in 2 overall categories :

_Functional Requirements_ capture functionality that the system must support. E.g. 'The user must be able to print money'.

_Non-functional Requirements_ capture constraints on the system and its operations. This can be speed, security, ethics, law, usability and other constraints. E.g. 'The user must be able to print 100000$/second'.

To better approximate useful categories of requirements we can extend the model.

## FURPS+

Is one such extended model. It is an acronym representing 

Functionality
Usability
Reliability
Performance
Security

+ Constraints/Pseudo requirements
  + Interface
  + Implementation
  + Legal
  + Packaging
  + Operations

## A well formulated requirement is...

Complete - all possible scenarios through system is included
Consistent - does not contain contradictions
Clarity - is unambiguously formulated
Correctness - accurately represents the system to the satisfaction of client and developers

Realistic - feasible to implement
Verifiable - is specified with measurable metrics
Traceable - rationale, dependencies etc. is traceable from/to the requirement

## Requirements elicitation activities

_Identifying actors_ - discover external systems & persons that interact with the system.
_Identifying scenarios_ - discover scenarios in which the system is used.
_Identifying use cases_ - derive use cases from scenarios
_Refining use cases_ - detail & complete use cases
_Identify nonfunctional requirements_ - specify usability, performance, security and other nonfunctional requirements.
