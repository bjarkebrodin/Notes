# Software Engineering Basics

Software Engineering is a collection of techniques,
methodologies, and tools that help with the production of
a high quality software system developed with a given
budget before a given deadline while change occurs

## Why software engineering? Challenges of software

Developing quality software is hard!

From Brooks: 

_Complexity_ 
  Complexity of software leads to difficult
  communication, product flaws, bugs, mana-
  genment difficulties and much more.

_Conformity_
  Software needs to conform to the interfa-
  ces it seeks to interact with, this leads
  to added complexity.

_Changeability_
  Software is often pressured for extended 
  functionality -> requirements change as 
  the software is being developed.
  Additionally, software may outlive the 
  platform for which it was written.

_Invisibility_
  Software has no 1:1 physical manifestation that we can use to *look at a piece of software. This brings challenges in the comprehension of software systems.

## Activities of software engineering

Modeling, model system & application domain
Problem-solving, formulate, analyze, discover, decide, specify
Knowledge aquisition, collect & formalize information
Rationale-management, capture context of decisions for later use

### Primary activities of software engineering
Specification
Development
Validation
Evolution

## Software proccess models

_Waterfall model_
  Plan-driven
  Distinct phases

_Incremental development_
  Interleaved cycles of specification, development and validation

_Reuse-oriented_
  Assemble system from existing components

_Scrum_
  Agile - do work in sprints
