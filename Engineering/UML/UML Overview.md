# UML Overview

UML is a modelling language for describing systems from different perspectives.


## Structual diagrams

Used for modeling the structure of a system.

Based on concepts of class, generalization and association we can model the structure of how different types of object are related within our system.

### Object diagram

As a class diagram, but instead of generic classes we use specific instances.

### Package diagram

Packages can be used to group elements adhering to connections functional cohesion, departemental relation or otherwise. Packages are often integrated in other diagrams

### Component diagram

Component diagrams are used to model components and interfaces of a system.

### Composition structure diagram

Hierarchically decomposed diagram, allowing for description of internal composition of classes or components.
