# Design Patterns

Design patterns are template solutions to ubiquitous problems, that someone has proposed. When a solution becomes acknowledged or adapted, we call it a design pattern. We divide design patterns in three categories: _architectural, behavioural & creational_.


## Architectural

#### MVC

#### MVVM

## Structural

#### Adapter

Reuse by adapting existing interface to required interface

#### Facade

Decouple subsytem from consumer by interacting with a unifying access point to said subsystem

#### Composition

#### Decorator

#### Bridge

#### Proxy

#### Decorator

## Behavioural

#### Observer

Observe/notify

#### Strategy

Choose algorithm independently

#### Command

Encapsulate commands in classes

#### Template method

Define abstract/default template methods, inherit to define specialized methods

#### Chain of responsibility

## Creational

#### Factory

Delegate choice of constructor to factory
